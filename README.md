# Quiz for week 8
## I have selected the light and shadow animation technique from the movie "Blade Runner 2049" as an inspiration. This film utilizes intricate lighting and shadows to create the ambiance of a futuristic city, especially scenes where characters move through dynamically lit environments, enhancing the dramatic and visual depth. Applying this technique can add rich emotional layers to visual narratives, making it a valuable method for visual design. Next, I need to find two high-quality screenshots from the movie to illustrate this light and shadow animation technique. This will help showcase the specific visual effects you aim to adopt in your project. Using p5.js to simulate light and shadow effects is an effective way to achieve the visual style seen in "Blade Runner 2049." p5.js offers various functions to simulate lighting effects, such as ambientLight(), pointLight(), and directionalLight(), which can be used to create dynamic light and shadow effects in 2D or 3D environments. This approach allows us to create dynamic and interactive visual presentations on web pages, enhancing the visual experience for users.
